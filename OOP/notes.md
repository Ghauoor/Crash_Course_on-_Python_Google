# OOP Notes
# Instance Variables
Variables that have diff values for diff instances of class are called Instance Variables.


# Methods
Methods are funcs that operate on the attr of a specific instance of class

# What Is a Method?
Calling methods on objects executes functions that operate on attributes of a specific instance of the class. This means that calling a method on a list, for example, only modifies that instance of a list, and not all lists globally. We can define methods within a class by creating functions inside the class definition. These instance methods can take a parameter called self which represents the instance the method is being executed on. This will allow you to access attributes of the instance using dot notation, like self.name, which will access the name attribute of that specific instance of the class object. When you have variables that contain different values for different instances, these are called instance variables.
