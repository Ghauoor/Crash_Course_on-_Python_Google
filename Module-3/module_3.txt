while Loop Terms
while loop - Tells the computer to execute a set of instructions while a specified condition is True. In other words, while loops keep executing the same group of instructions until the condition becomes False.

infinite loop - Missing a method for exiting the loop, causing the loop to run forever.

break - A keyword that can be used to end a loop at a specific point. 


A recursive function must include a recursive case and base case. The recursive case calls the function again, with a different value. The base case returns a value without calling the same function.
